# Connect Legs

Was sewing together both the left and right leg.
Was interesting to sew a curved shape.
At some point the seams were really thick due to multiple layers. 
The instruction said I should fold and sew it, which seemed not possibel to me.

# Learnings

- Folding fabric to often makes it really thick and hard to sew
- Sewing aroudn curves requires precision
