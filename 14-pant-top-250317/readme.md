# Pant Top

Was adding the top of the pant by folding it and sewing parts together.

Involved creating button holes, for which I did a test for that before adding it to the pant, that was smart.

Included the rubber band and the belt with a 3D printed part.

Used a little security needle to help pull the band through the pant.

Also left a little unsewed helper part for better integration of them.


## Learnings

- Always do a test for button holes on some unused fabric
- Close helper seams only when you are sure everything is done properly
