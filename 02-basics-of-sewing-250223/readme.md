# Basics of Sewing

First day with hands on textiles, patterns and sewing.


## Sewing Patterns

Had a look at really nice sewing patterns from a japanese book I have ordered.
Glued together a sewing pattern from single sheets, that I have been buying.


## Preparing Textile

Was ironing textile to make it smooth.
The textile is folded, which seems to be pretty important.


## Sewing Machine

First use of sewing machine. 
Learned how to insert thread into it.
Was using two types of stitches, one regular and one zig zag pattern.
The machine is very interesting and pulls the textile through all by itself.

You first need to lift the sewing thing, insert the textile and place it back down.
With the basic stitch pattern you sew a few stitches forth and then back to seal it.
After that you can continue to the textile until you do that again.
You can adjust the length of each step to fit your needs.

The zig zag pattern is good to secure the edges of the fabric which tends to spread out.
Here you do not need the sealing step since it might not need it.
You can control the with of the steps and also the length of them.


## Learnings

- Sewing Patterns can be a piece of art itself
- The sewing machine needs to be controlled not to be too fast by itself
