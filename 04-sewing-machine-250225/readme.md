# Sewing Machine

Getting a sewing machine and prepare for making a pant.


## Choosing a Sewing Machine

Was in a small sewing machine shop and asked for their oppinion on what to get. 

They were friendly and gave good support on what to consider.

They suggested a pfaff passport 2.0 which is a compact but also versatile machine.

After some evaluation I decided to get this machine and am very excited.


## Preparing to Sew a Pant

Also got new fabric for a pant. It is jersey cotton in black. Was not too expensive.

Did transfer sewing patterns to paper and then to fabric to cut the shapes.

Learned a nice technique with folding special edges which then are sewed together.

This creates a nice edge finish without using a zig zag or similar to seal it.


## Learnings

- Using an iron the get sharp edges is very important
- You can create nice edges when folding fabric and sewing both parts
