# Pant Parts

Was sewing the front and back parts of both legs together.

Went quite smooth with ironing and folding.

Had a little issue with sewing over the edge of one pocket. 

The opening was shiften when moving over the sewing part and created a little unwanted fold there.


## Learnings

- Pay attention to open ends like pockets since they can create wrinkles when sewed the wrong direction
- Keep the edges of the fabric close together and adjust when needed
