# Simple Bag

Making a simple bag with two parts and some handles on top.


## Instructions

The main parts have been around 40x50cm squares with a fold on one side, so it is actually double the amount of fabric.

It is sewed together on both sides, so that the opposite of the fold is left open.

The pattern was a straight line, as well as a zig zag to seal it.

Also had to refill the bottom thread which was quite interesting.


## Shopping Textiles

Went to some stores to shop textiles and had a look at some sewing machines.

There are stores with huge amount of textile which is great, but makes it also hard to choose one.

Bought some nettle cloth, which is cheap cotton that you can use to test your patterns.

Also had a look at some sewing machines but still not quite sure what to get.


## Learnings

- A nettle cloth is used to check and adjust patterns without using expensice textiles
- It is important the seal the things stitches you make
