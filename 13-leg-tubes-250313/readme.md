# Leg Tubes

Was attatching the small tubes to each end of the legs to strengthen it.
Noticed that when the fabric stripes are not equal in length they tend to create wraps.
This is not so nice to sew and looks not ideal, but in this case it was hidden in the inside of the legs.

Another thing I noticed was that multiple layers of french seams tend to get really thick.
That is something the sewing machine struggles with and also is creating wraps there.
Am not shure how to avoid this, but maybe placing them slightly next to each other.


## Learnings

- Pay attention that attatched tubes have the same length
- Avoid seams to overlap since it is hard to sew and shifts the fabric
