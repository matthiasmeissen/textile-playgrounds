# Sewing Space

Was buidling a new sewing space in my room.

It is now much more clean and ironing while standing is much more comfortable.

Also connected the bottom attatchments of the legs.

## Learnings
- It takes a bit of time to prepare for sewing
- Having things at a fixed and clean place helps a lot
