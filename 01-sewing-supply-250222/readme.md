# Sewing Supply

This place serves as a space to document my progress in working with textiles.


## Introdcution

The topic of textiles and sewing is very new to me and I have never done any work with them.

However it is very interesting to see how fabric and textile have shaped humanity.

I think it is a skill that is worth learning and beeing able to make own colthes maybe.


## Supply

In order to get started with sewing I was asking a few people what to get first.

**Cutting**
- Fabric Scissors: Only and really only for cutting fabric
- Rotary Cutter: For long cuts and precise curves, should be used with cutting mat

**Marking**
- Fabric Clips: An alternative to pins
- Tailors Chalk: Some chalk to mark fabric
- Marking Pen: Also for marking things, can be removed with water

**Measuring**
- Measuring Tape: Flexible tape to measure things
- Small Measuring Ruler: To measure small things on fabric

**Materials**
- Sewing Thread: Some thread in different colors for sewing
- Fabrics: Got some cotton in plain white and one with a pattern

I did not get a sewing machine, iron and cutting mat since those will be avaible to me in some place.


## Learnings

- Making textiles is a process that humans have been doing for a very long time
- Choosing textile involves a lot of feeling the fabric itself
