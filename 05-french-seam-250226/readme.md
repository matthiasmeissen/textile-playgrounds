# French Seam

Making a pant and learning how to do a french seam.


## Introduction

Was using my new sewing machine for the first time.

Also did a test piece of my first pant using nettle farbric.

Learned a new seam called the french seam which makes nice connecting of fabric.


## How it works

You place both parts together the way they will look when done.

Meaning the outer parts facing outwards. Or in technical with the normals facing outwards.

Then you stitch them together with roughy 0.5 cm distance.

You then iron it  to make the seam very flat.

After that you invert it, so that the normals are pointing inwards.

Then you place a seam that is a bit longer the the first you did, so rougly around 1 cm or so.

When done you flip it back to have the normals pointing outward again.

Thats it, you only need to iron it again to make it look nice.


## Learnings

- The french seam is a nice way to have smooth connections of fabric
- Paying attention to which sind the fabric is facing is important
